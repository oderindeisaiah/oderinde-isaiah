## Projects

Here are my main projects featured on the portfolio:

| Project Name | Description | GitHub |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Password Hashing Tool** | Secure password authentication with SHA-256 hashing, limited login attempts, and persistent storage. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/password-hashing-tool) |
| **File Integrity Checker** | Monitors files for changes using SHA-256 hashes and logs modifications for auditing purposes. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/file-integrity-checker) |
| **Login Defender** | Protects accounts from brute-force attacks using login limits, time-based logouts, and secure password storage. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/login-defender) |
| **Password Auditor** | Evaluates password strength, identifies weak credentials, and simulates breach checks locally. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/password-auditor) |
| **Secure Notes Vault** | Encrypted local storage for sensitive notes using AES (Fernet). Password-protected access ensures privacy and security. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/secure-notes-vault) |
| **Mini_IDS** | Detects brute-force attacks and credential stuffing in authentication logs. Alerts are classified by severity: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/mini-ids) |
| **Security Log Analyzer** | Analyzes authentication logs to detect suspicious activity and generate alerts for potential brute-force or malicious login attempts. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/security-log-analyzer) |
| **File Encryptor** | Encrypts and decrypts local files securely using modern cryptography to ensure data confidentiality. | [View](https://github.com/oderindeisaiah/file-encryptor) |
